		<p>
			What if I told you Aliens where real?<br>
			<br>
			Well they are in fact real. However this is not something to celebrate.
			These extraterrestrial lifeform's goal is nothing of the total control 
			of human kind<br>
			<br>
			Among the community these are called the Donut Aliens or DAs for short.
			you might think it is rather a silly name but let me assure you that this is 
			most likely the destruction of a free human kind unless we do something about it.  
			These aliens brought donuts to earth. You may think that this is a good thing but 
			you could not be more wrong.  Every donut a person eats more of their mind is 
			taken over by the DAs.  After a certain amount of donuts the DAs will completely 
			take over your mind.

		<p>
			These lifeforms look very similar to their mind controlling creation. 
			(see artist recreation to the right) 
			Their outer skin is most often perfectly smooth and glossy, but some mutations
			they get cause the texture of their skin to change.  One variant causes the 
			skin to begin to break down into tiny little white particles, this was the inspiration 
			for the powdered donut.  The skin can also wrinkle up which is where the inspiration for 
			the cake donut.  one other mutation is they get many colorful warts popping up, you can 
			probably guess what this inspired, sprinkles of coarse.They most often appear Torus, 
			but when they eat the hole in the middle closes around their current meal.  
			When fully digested it turns into a cream, jam, or chocolate like substance.  
			The Donut aliens then survive off of this filling, similar to how earth animals
			use fat. soon after eating a small hole opens up and expands as the creature uses 
			its stored energy until eventually growing back to its normal size meaning it is ready 
			to eat again.

		<h2>A Brief History</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				prehistory- The DAs brought donuts to several cultures throughout human 
				existence.  This caused humans to build structures for the DAs. Some examples 
				of these structures include the Egyptian Pyramids, and stone hedge.
			</li>
			<li>
				1847- The DAs abducted 16 year old Hanson Gregory from a lime-trading ship.  The DAs then force fed
				young Gregory thousands of donuts gaining complete control over his mind.
				he is credited with putting the hole in the donut which causes its mind control
				powers to exponentially increase. 
			</li>
			<li>
				1938- The first National Donut day. A win for the DAs a loss for us who know the truth.
			</li>
			<li>
				around 1950- The Donut Aliens began their control of the police. "Accepted history" says that they 
				started eating donuts because donut places where the only things open durning late night shifts, do 
				you think this was a coincidence, of course not, the Donut Aliens wanted to take over our law enforcement
				so they made the only places open donut shops.  Notice that only now that they have a strangle hold on the police
				other places are open that late at night. Think about it!!
			</li>
			<li>
				2004- This organization, The Donut Alien Truthers, is founded and is dedicated to spreading the truth.
			</li>

		<h2>Our mission</h2>
		<p>
			The Donut Alien Truthers founded in 2004 by our benevolent, and frankly quite attractive, leader Kendrick 
			Farnsworth.  Our mission is to spread awareness of the dangers of eating donuts and how to protect yourself 
			from the oppressive aliens that seek to control your mind.  We are a profit organization that appreciates 
			any donations.  Thank you for all of your support and welcome to the fight of your life.
